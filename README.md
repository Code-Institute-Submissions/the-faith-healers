# The Faith Healers
A local group of 4 guys with guitars, performing your favourite sing-along pub classics. 
The band wants to use their site to showcase their music in order to make bookings to perform at pubs, local events, and festivals. 

The target audiences for this website are event organisers, pub landlords and fans, to view and listen to the band's material, read reviews and contact the band for new bookings.

## External links: 
Facebook, YouTube, SoundCloud, email
## Reviews: 
Local pub-goers and event organisers
## UX: (and features)
* As an event organiser/pub landlord etc I want to be able to see a video/listen to some clips of the band so I know what I am potentially booking. easy navigation on a mobile device, something a band member can take out of their pocket at the bar and show to the manager asking if they do live music.
* As a fan I'd like some more info about the band, the band members and to see pictures, videos, listen to their music and see when/where they are next playing. from mobile to desktop, fans could be directed to/from here to/from social media. pages should be fast loading, images should be easy to flick through. audio clips should be playable on the webpage, not on an external page.
## Features left to implement:
Creating a 'contact us' form with back-end technology to send booking requests to the band
## Technologies used:
* HTML5 (semantic)
* CSS3 (styling)
* Bootstrap - grid system, CSS, Font Awesome, Google Fonts
## Testing:
_go over UX points and bullet step by step what happens_
_work out how each page looks/works in mobile/tablet/desktop view_
_mention any interesting bugs/problems that have been discovered (even if not resolved yet)_
## Deployment:
_describe each commit
push to github pages_
